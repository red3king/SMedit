BUGS
    undo / redo is completely messed up and ends up in a crash
    
    handmade makefile:
        - does not realize header files have been changed
        - I don't think it captures that cogging needs to happen before compiling, they may be running as tasks at the same time!
    
    make a 2x wider state and a normal size one, then...
        connect the 2 states,
        zoom out a bunch (may not be necessary),
        rotate the smamll one around the big one,
            ...and the transition doesnt always stay stuck to both, it disconnects (visually only) from the small one sometimes.
