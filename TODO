RIGHT NOW LEFT OFF HERE:
    text seems to be working, but:
        -the text appears above where i assumed it would be
        -the text is white (or possibly reusing the same fill color grey from beforoe)
            instead of the red/black i was testing out
        -when i zoom way out, i see something going red so the red is being applied,
            somehow, but not to the text...



=== for later === 
add error checks to everything that could fail:
    opengl init
    font load
    ... check nanovg examples for all error codes that they check

when done, test to see if things get screwed up if a gui operation is in progress (eg, dragging a state), and you drag away from the gl area, release the mb, and then come back. presumably it would enter a weird state and you would have to click and release once more to release the state.

if GuiOpResult.CANCEL is going to be a thing, then whene it's returned, we may need to silently undo the last operation? figure out how that's gonna work, if cancel is to be a thing. could be used when you drag a state off the 

enforce no undo / redo while there is a gui operation
    so gui operations with pointers to "current whatever" wont break because user pressedd ctrl z
