TODO

    - draw transitions going between 2 states apart from each other so they can be differentiated
    - persist which corner a loopback transition is in, in the save file and in the gui after undoing and redoing
    - implement controller for project file which maniuplates a list of strings, each containing an event name that should be held in a queue instead of immediately pushed into the machine

    - tab should be 4 spaces in code editor


    
    - implement the local and server options:
        - enable/disable autopan
        - minimum state transition time on server 

    - implement box entity corner resize
    
    - refactor the move state/resourcelock operations into a single move box entity operation class for consistency's sake
    
    - find a way to catch errors in the functions sent into the twisted event loop, 
        and display those on the client.

    - fix drawing order to be same as click event handling order
        (resourcelocks last, either states or transitions first, i think transitions?)
 
    - check known issues file



=== for later === 

CHECK - that all object modifications are done by submitting operations and i didnt accidentally write direct modification that will mess up the history system`:

add error checks to everything that could fail:
    opengl init
    font load
    ... check nanovg examples for all error codes that they check

when done, test to see if things get screwed up if a gui operation is in progress (eg, dragging a state), and you drag away from the gl area, release the mb, and then come back. presumably it would enter a weird state and you would have to click and release once more to release the state.

if GuiOpResult.CANCEL is going to be a thing, then whene it's returned, we may need to silently undo the last operation? figure out how that's gonna work, if cancel is to be a thing. could be used when you drag a state off the 

enforce no undo / redo while there is a gui operation
    so gui operations with pointers to "current whatever" wont break because user pressedd ctrl z
