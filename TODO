right now - getting it to work
    it compiles and runs but is currently showing nothing on the screen 
        when I add a render call on any event received, the thing sometimes suddenly renders gray everywhere,
        even outside of the glarea. may have set up the wrong viewport initialization/size stuff..



    





=== for later === 

when done, test to see if things get screwed up if a gui operation is in progress (eg, dragging a state), and you drag away from the gl area, release the mb, and then come back. presumably it would enter a weird state and you would have to click and release once more to release the state.

if GuiOpResult.CANCEL is going to be a thing, then whene it's returned, we may need to silently undo the last operation? figure out how that's gonna work, if cancel is to be a thing. could be used when you drag a state off the 

enforce no undo / redo while there is a gui operation
    so gui operations with pointers to "current whatever" wont break because user pressedd ctrl z
