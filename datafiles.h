/*
 *  When we install into /usr/local/bin, we need to load resources from /usr/share or something like that
 *  Right now the program uses relative paths but that will fail.
 *  So we need to load from /usr/share/official_location when installed as a deb package, but frrom ./whatever 
 *  when built from source.
 *
 *  This file is where those two sets of file locations are to be stored.
