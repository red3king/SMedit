 
This project is a demonstration of custom state classes. The custom state class defined here is RandomChooser. It has two outgoing transitions, A and B, and picks between them with a user configurable percentage weighting.

Custom state classes are motivated by doing more interesting things like async web requests, but this was my simple test case and the only example for now.
