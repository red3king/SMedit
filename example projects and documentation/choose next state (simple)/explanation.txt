A simple example, a single state machine demonstrating how to have a state ("random chooser") choose its successor state.

This is accomplished by having a set of outgoing event transitions. The state chooses its successor state by emitting an event corresponding to its sucessor.


Note that as of this writing, the "random chooser" state never appears highlighted, since it immediately goes to either state A or B.
