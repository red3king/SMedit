 
This project consists of two state machines which start at launch, and then fight over a resource lock.

The resource does nothing.

Each state machine cycles between 3 states with timeout transitions. One of the 3 states is contained in a resource lock.

One state machine moves between its states quickly, the other moves slowly. Watch the quick one, every few seconds it will pause as it is waiting for the lock.
